CustomCursor is a plugin for [SpringRoll](http://github.com/SpringRoll/SpringRoll). It is designed to be a self contained way to have an on-canvas cursor with normal and pointer states, when using the SpringRoll forks of EaselJS and PixiJS.

Note: due to currently ongoing changes to our Pixi support and loading process, the PixiJS side of this has not been implemented within this library yet.

##Installation

CustomCursor can be installed using Bower.

```bash
bower install http://github.com/SpringRoll/CustomCursor
```

##Usage

Include easeljs-customcursor.min.js or pixi-customcursor.min.js in your libraries js or html, after your other libraries.
